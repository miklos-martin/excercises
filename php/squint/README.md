# Squint

Squares of integers

I've met with this excercise in this blog (about functional programming) https://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/12/22/FPBE1-Whats-it-all-about.html

### Implement it in php!

Try hard to mimic the clojure form of the program, which is `(take 25 (squares-of (integers)))`

Also, make the function declarations better with proper type hints.
